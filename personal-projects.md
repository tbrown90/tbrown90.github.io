[Loan Calculator](http://loancalculator.iamtjbrown.com/) — I developed this small app as a means of teaching myself the heroku platform, brush up on Node and AngularJS, and as a means to help calculate loan payments (specifically my student loans).

[Must Should Want](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.iamtjbrown.msw) — This is a mobile app designed to help with productivity. Every morning you get a notification to set three goals. A goal you must accomplish (a goal that has an immediate effect), a goal you should accomplish (a goal that is more long term oriented), and a goal you want to accomplish (a goal that is more for fun or entertainment). The app was created using Cordova, Javascript, AngularJS, HTML, and CSS
