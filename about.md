I am a software engineer with experience developing applications for the **web, desktop,** and **mobile devices**. I primarily work in **C#, Java, JavaScript,** and **HTML** and I have no trouble learning a new language. I thrive in a test-driven development environment, creating stable and maintainable applications. I am a team player and can work equally efficiently independently or as part of a pair.

I have worked on many types for projects during my career. I have created small report generating applications that connect to large criminal databases to draw their data, simple Android and iOS video games, marketing web-applications used by some of the largest telecom companies of the U.S, as well as large governmental and eCommerce web sites. In my free time, I enjoy experimenting with new languages and programming techniques; designing and developing my own video games and personal applications to fix simple problems I come across.
