	<article class="post-content">
		<p>I am a full-stack software engineer with 7+ years of experience developing applications for the <strong>web, desktop,</strong> and <strong>mobile devices</strong>. 
			I primarily work in <strong>C#, Java, JavaScript,</strong> and <strong>HTML</strong> but I try to familiarize myself with other languages and technologies in my personal development time. 
			I thrive in a test-driven development environment, creating stable and maintainable applications. 
			I am a team player and can work equally efficiently independently or as part of a pair.</p>

		<p>I have worked on many types and sizes of projects during my career from static webpages like this one to enterprise scale web applications that serve millions of requests per day.
			I am passionate with my work and do my best to challenging problems quickly and efficiently. I enjoy experimenting with new languages, technologies, and techniques by designing and developing my own video games, web sites, and personal applications to keep myself up to date in this field.
