I am a full-stack software engineer with 7+ years of experience developing applications for the **web, desktop,** and **mobile devices**. I primarily work in **C#, Java, JavaScript,** and **HTML** but I try to familiarize myself with other languages and technologies in my personal development time. I thrive in a test-driven development environment, creating stable and maintainable applications. I am a team player and can work equally efficiently independently or as part of a pair.

I have worked on many types and sizes of projects during my career from static webpages like this one to small indie video games to enterprise scale web applications that serve millions of requests per day. I am passionate with my work and do my best to challenging problems quickly and efficiently. I enjoy experimenting with new languages, technologies, and techniques by designing and developing my own video games, web sites, and personal applications to keep myself up to date in this field.
