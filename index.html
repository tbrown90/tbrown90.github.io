	<article class="post-content">
		<p>I am a software engineer with experience developing applications for the <strong>web, desktop,</strong> and <strong>mobile devices</strong>. I primarily work in <strong>C#, Java, JavaScript,</strong> and <strong>HTML</strong> and I have no trouble learning a new language. I thrive in a test-driven development environment, creating stable and maintainable applications. I am a team player and can work equally efficiently independently or as part of a pair.</p>

		<p>I have worked on many types for projects during my career. I have created small report generating applications that connect to large criminal databases to draw their data, simple Android and iOS video games, marketing web-applications used by some of the largest telecom companies of the U.S, as well as large governmental and eCommerce web sites. In my free time, I enjoy experimenting with new languages and programming techniques; designing and developing my own video games and personal applications to fix simple problems I come across.</p>
