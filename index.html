            I am a full-stack software engineer with over 10 years of experience developing applications for the <strong>web, desktop,</strong> and <strong>mobile devices</strong>. 
            I am a team player and can work equally efficiently independently or as part of a pair.

            I have worked on many types and sizes of projects during my career from static webpages like this one to small indie video games to enterprise scale web applications that 
            serve millions of requests per day. I am passionate with my work and do my best to challenging problems quickly and efficiently. I enjoy experimenting with new 
            languages, technologies, and techniques by designing and developing my own video games, web sites, and personal applications to keep myself up to date in this field.
        </p>

            I have advanced professional knowledge of <strong>Java, C#, JavaScript, HTML, CSS,</strong> and <strong>SQL</strong> and intermediate knowledge of the 
            <strong>AWS</strong> cloud ecosystem. As a hobbyist, I have intermediate knowledge of <strong>Unity3D, Unreal Engine, C,</strong> and <strong>C++</strong> and I'm 
            knowledgeable on techniques and technologies related to video game development. I consider myslef to have excellent problem solving and critical thinking skills.
